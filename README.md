Artificial Intelligence - Genetic Algorithms Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

- To clone this project simply press code -> copy the link -> open your directory in the terminal where you want the file and type:
'git clone directory-link'

- Install the requirements with 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in the terminal
- Run the files in the jupyter notebook, ensuring you run the imports section
- Run each function cell
- Call the genetic algorithm and using the main, define the file name and the parameter settings
- There is also a test file that constructs simple unit tests validating that they function correctly on a smaller level
