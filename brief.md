Project Number 1: Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem

 

In this assignment, you will implement a genetic algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

To do:

    Implement core genetic algorithm components (selection, crossover, mutation)
    Understand parameter tuning and its impact on algorithm performance
    Analyse algorithm performance and solution quality

 

Requirements

(A) Core Implementation 

    Implement a genetic algorithm with:

   - Population initialization

   - Selection mechanism

   - At least two different crossover operators

   - At least two different mutation operators

   - Fitness evaluation

  

    Your implementation must:

   Accept TSPLIB format files as input

   Output the best solution found

   Plot fitness over generations

   Report computational time

 

(b)  Experiments 

    Compare performance with different parameter settings:

   - Population sizes

   - Crossover rates

   - Mutation rates

 

    Test your implementation on at least three different TSPLIB instances:

   - Small (under 100 cities)

   - Medium (100-500 cities)

   - Large (over 500 cities)

 

(c) Documentation and Analysis 

Technical Report including:

   Implementation details and design choices

   Experimental results and analysis

   Performance comparison with known optimal solutions

   Discussion of potential improvements

 

Suggested Datasets

berlin52 (52 cities)

kroA100 (100 cities)

pr1002 (1002 cities)

 

I recommend using a small toy example first to ensure your approach is working correctly.

 

    Correctness and completeness of implementation (25%)
    Quality of solutions compared to known optima (25%)
    Experimental design and analysis (25%)
    Code quality and documentation (10%)
    Technical report quality (15%)

 

All sources must be cited - any incomplete citation will lead to a reduction in marks.

A small sample of submissions will be examined with short interview.

To submit:

    Source code (well-documented)  (link to github will suffice)
    Technical report (PDF, max 10 pages)
    Short file outlining how to use the code - Setup instructions, Examples of uses, parameters
